# Week 12 <br> 
## Update on project <br> 
This is what I have so far... I know not much. Karen has helped me to redirect myself and my situation. Right now the concept is to deconstruct and reconstruct the mysterious idea of a secret/confession. Deconstructing the secret for it to no longer be readable metephorically represents a secret in hiding. Thats where the generative design is introduced, creating 'glitchy' text from the user's input. If this project was fully completed, I think it'll be a great tool for those who are bad at keeping in secrets aha. <br> 

Adding in a text menu/ mode really helped, as it organised the sketch and made it less confusing for me. Also created an input field, and instead of a button I've decided to do a key press as I thought that made more sense. Inplementing the typography aspect was tricky at first and still isn't up to its par, however I have somewhat combined the two sketches to finally produce an imcomplete, poorly drawn project? I still need to play around with the parameters and distortions. As well as trying to get the input.value() to perform the animation. <br>

## Just some final thoughts of the course overall <br>
I think it's safe to say that coding is not my forte. I've really underestimated the work of coding, generative design and in general web based sources. Making small things can lead to large coding sketches. It's hard work. I choose this course purely to experience something i've never done before, to try something new, and I did. The course succeed my expectations and I'm satisfied honestly. <br> 

Trying to understand code language and overall the process of coding was a lot to take in as a first time coder. It was a BIG learning curve. However, I really enjoyed the learning experience as I would've never thought in my life to learn code nor understand it (and still don't understand it). It was a hidden matter. I don't think I will dig further into coding but I will still be mindful of it in the future and will never take it for granted. I'm dissapointed in myself for not producing a sketch that was 'exciting' or 'interative', and going downwards instead of upwards at the worst possible time period. But even though I didn't successfully complete a working sketch/project sadly, Im still proud of myself of what i've achieved and how much knowledge i've gained. <br>

The knowledge that i've gained from this course was super helpful as it gave me an insight of the basics of web design and generative art production, and that's what I will take away from this. I really enjoyed researching generative art designers and seeing the limitless outcomes you can produce with so many unique concepts. It was a wow factor. This whole course was a WOW factor. I really give props to Karen who made the learning experience engaging and fun and her understanding of the hardships of coding.

# Week 9
## Progress of project 
__Changes__ <br>
I have made a slight change for my project. Instead of producing an image from the confession, it will produce a game involving the letters to form its surroundings. Users will be able to interact with it, 'playing with your secret'. So far i've explored the use of buttons as well as interaction with up and down keys. <br>

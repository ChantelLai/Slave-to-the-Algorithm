# Week 9
## Progress of project 
__Changes__ <br>
I have made a slight change for my project as I was stuck on how to go further with the weavings. Instead of producing an image from the confession, it will produce a game involving the letters to form its surroundings. Users will be able to interact with it, 'playing with your secret'. So far i've explored the use of buttons as well as interaction with up and down keys. <br>

[This example](https://p5js.org/examples/interaction-snake-game.html) guided me with how to create somewhat of a moving game, the up, down, left and right arrow keys. The letters that pop up are from a sketch that we went through in class from karen. So i've taken some lines of code from there and combined it with the game. I now need to figure out how to combine both the starting page and game together.

## Research/ Artists <br> 
Sebastian Schmieg - [Segmentation.Network](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bmybpw/artificial-neural-network-visualization) - visualizes the image outlines created by Amazon Mechanical Turk workers for Microsoftâ€™s COCO project. It plays back is a random collage of image segmentations at their original position. Each segmentation consists of multiple coordinates, and the piece shows the manual process of creating these coordinates in fast-forward.

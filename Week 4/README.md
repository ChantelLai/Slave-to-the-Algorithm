## Activity <br/>

## Research <br/>
I've further researched some artists to get an idea how I should be conceptually and creatively thinking. I came across [Phillip Stearns](https://phillipstearns.com/artwork) and his work is absolutely amazing! I love the simplicity yet conceptual ideal in his work. Its very effiective interaction wise from a viewers point. <br/> 
Some notable works of Stearns that I love: <br/>
1. [Raw Data](https://phillipstearns.com/artwork#/raw-data/) <br/>
2. [Mortal Threads](https://phillipstearns.com/artwork#/mortal-threads/) <br/>
3. [Ambient Environments](https://phillipstearns.com/artwork#/ambient-environments/) <br/>
4. [AA Consequence of Infinitely Discursive Vision Technologies](https://phillipstearns.com/artwork#/consequence/) <br/> 

His work where it involves cotton weaving into tapestries are asethetically beautiful! His use of bright colours with such great detail really shows the critical work through the wooden stretcher. They look as if they were made digitally, the insane detail it has. He says <br/> 
- " The project uses digital practices and processes to blur the lines between photography, data visualization, textile design, and computer science. The result are works of visual art that serve not only to render visible the invisible processes mediating everyday experience, but also to operate as distinctly tactile and lo-fi digital storage mediaâ€”the process becomes a means to capture, record, and transmit data."

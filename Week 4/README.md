# Week 4 <br/>

## In Class <br/>
Today's class was a processing workshop exploring how to use image and text. I found this really helpful and exciting as I was really interested in the type and image side of generative design. 

## Project Pitch <br/>
For my pitch I would want to explore the idea of combining polygraph test/ sensors to our body to convert them into art pieces. I had the idea of individuals doing a polygraph test, answering yes or no questions to scary intimidating life questions, to then produce a weaving/ embroidery art piece. I wanted to showcase human connection and the difference between a person's view to another. The outcome would be a large canvas showing different peoples polygraphs wavelengths. <br/>

## Research <br/>
I've further researched some artists to get an idea how I should be conceptually and creatively thinking. I came across [Phillip Stearns](https://phillipstearns.com/artwork) and his work is absolutely amazing! I love the simplicity yet conceptual ideal in his work. Its very effiective interaction wise from a viewers point. This can also help me with the weaving/ embroidery material for my pitch.  <br/> 
Some notable works of Stearns that I love: <br/>
1. [Raw Data](https://phillipstearns.com/artwork#/raw-data/) <br/>
2. [Mortal Threads](https://phillipstearns.com/artwork#/mortal-threads/) <br/>
3. [Ambient Environments](https://phillipstearns.com/artwork#/ambient-environments/) <br/>
4. [AA Consequence of Infinitely Discursive Vision Technologies](https://phillipstearns.com/artwork#/consequence/) <br/> 

His work where it involves cotton weaving into tapestries are asethetically beautiful! His use of bright colours with such great detail really shows the critical work through the wooden stretcher. They look as if they were made digitally, the insane detail it has. He says <br/> 
- " The project uses digital practices and processes to blur the lines between photography, data visualization, textile design, and computer science. The result are works of visual art that serve not only to render visible the invisible processes mediating everyday experience, but also to operate as distinctly tactile and lo-fi digital storage mediaâ€”the process becomes a means to capture, record, and transmit data." - Fragmented Memory <br/>

# Week 3 Non Human Machines 
## In Class 
In this week's class, we discussed about drawing machines and non human machines. Possibilities of working with animals, trees or wind as well as with natural forces such as gravity or centrifugal force to create non human drawing machines or systems. 

## Non Human Machine Activity 
At first when Karen was explaining the activity to create our own non human machines, I was planning on using my body and attaching a pen while walking around my house. However, I didn't have the tools to create a contraption on my body. Instead I gathered a coat stand and a coat hanger,attaching a sharpie with string to the coat hanger, outside on my balcony to use the force of the wind to move the sharpie on the paper. The first test I used one pen on an a4 sheet of paper. The second test I used two pens on a a3 sheet of paper. From this activity, the artwork it created is original, which you will not be able to replucate. The use of non human machines can create unique and original work within an algorithmic system. It can differ every time. 

## Research 
Karen had named a few great artists that had produced other non human machines which I found fascinating. Here are some artists that caught my attention: <br/>
[Margie Livingston](http://www.gregkucera.com/livingston.htm) - Day hike <br/>
[Tim Knowles](http://www.timknowles.co.uk/Work/TreeDrawings/tabid/265/Default.aspx) - Tree drawings  <br/>
[Eske Rex](https://www.eskerex.com/?portfolio_page=drawingmachine-series) - Drawing machine <br/>

These artists have explored the range of non human machines from the use of nature to automated mechanic machines. Livingston uses the nature as her 'paint'. The markings in her works are from objects shes encountered along the way of her hikes. Knowles also uses the natural breeze that blows the trees to then move the attached pens to paper. Kind of ironic right? paper drawing on paper. It amazes me the uniqueness of these natural 'machines' producing original work that can never be reproduced again. Whereas, rex's work is the literal true meaning of a drawing machine. Self explanitory 

## Pitch Project 
Just some quick ideas and thoughts that i've thought of for the pitch project:<br/>
1. Relationship between sound and visuals <br/>
2. Digital vs analog? virtual vs physical? <br/>
3. Using and collecting data to create visuals? or sounds? <br/>
4. Converting written work, poems or passages, to visuals? <br/>
<br/>
From these points will then to continue research further of what I specifically want to do and in what field I want to take. Originally, I wanted to to do something involving with data and how that could be put into something visually. Geometric shapes and design style is also something I enjoy to see asethetically. However, I am still not too sure yet. There are too many ideas that I dont know where to start. Ideas in this field are LIMITLESS. 

## Final Thoughts
Some things to think about and to do:<br/>
- Pitch project - what, why and how - concept wise and research how
- Continue to research other algorthmic art/ Generative design/art
- " Project = technology (possibility) + bluesky idea x life experience/ interest " - Andy

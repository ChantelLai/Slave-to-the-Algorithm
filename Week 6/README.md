# Week 6 <br>
## In Class <br>


### Paper Prototyping <br>
Paper prototyping is "In human–computer interaction, paper prototyping is a widely used method in the user-centered design process, a process that helps developers to create software that meets the user's expectations and needs—in this case, especially for designing and testing user interfaces". <br>

This activity we did in class explored how we could construct our projects step by step. While doing this activity, it felt like it was how game creators would create video games. Cutting out certain items that would be moving and drawing objects that would be stationary are the basics of how a game/design should work and to test the application. Andy demonstrated that this is how we should approach out projects, to apply this method of step by step progression. <br>

Our group decided on bomberman, an old favourite. As looking back now, i've realised that majority if everything should be a moving object (items, bombs, bricks, bombermen) except for the main stones. However, the process of this was interesting in terms of creation.  <br>

### Processing <br>
We also experimented with p5.js in Processing which I was very excited about as we were learning about sound and audio.

# Week 8 <br>
## In Class <br>
### Paper Prototype <br/> 
Prototype of what the structure of the project would look like <br/>

### Pseudo code for my Project <br/> 
FUNCTION speech to text <br/> 
INPUT speech <br/> 
IF audio to text is detected and correct <br/> 
	THEN continue <br/> 
ELSE IF not detected <br/> 
	THEN try again <br/> 

FUNCTION draw text <br/> 
FOR the text written <br/> 
DO random pick three main words <br/> 
IF word is chosen <br/> 
	draw zig zag lines in red <br/> 
ELSE IF other word is chosen <br/> 
	draw diagonal line in green <br/> 
ELSE IF other word chosen <br/> 
	draw triangles in blue <br/> 
ELSE IF length of text is > 20 words <br/> 
	draw large <br/> 
ELSE IF length of text is < 20 words <br/> 
	draw small <br/> 

FUNCTION text to image <br/> 
FOR draw text <br/> 
DO make final image <br/> 
THEN weaving image <br/> 
END IF image is complete <br/> 
OUTPUT weaving tapestry  <br/> 

### Experimentation <br>
To further explore weavings from last week. I've experimented with weaving type animations on processing to determine how I could somehow mimic a weaving gesture. I've found some examples and altered them to the point where it's erratic and entwine like. This experimentation in class has lead me to the idea of potentially using this tool for the project. <br>

### Processing - Speech to Text <br>
Speech to text experimentation in todays workshop! Which will be very helpful for my project. <br>

## Project Now <br>
I've decided to use the speech library as a tool for the input of my project. I've explore speech to text library, however I did not know how to import it. But luckily Karen went through it in class. So far im not sure what I want the appearance/asethetic/theme of the project to look like just yet. I do want the project to be a web based site where users can go on and test. <br>

__Questions to think about__ <br> 
- How can these secrets be turned in a weaving animation? <br>
- How will the user be inputing their words? <br>
- What is the purpose for this? <br>

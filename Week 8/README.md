# Week 8 <br>
## In Class <br>
### Paper Prototype <br/> 
Prototype of what the structure of the project would look like <br/>

### Pseudo code for my Project <br/> 
FUNCTION speech to text <br/> 
INPUT speech <br/> 
IF audio to text is detected and correct <br/> 
	THEN continue <br/> 
ELSE IF not detected <br/> 
	THEN try again <br/> 

FUNCTION draw text <br/> 
FOR the text written <br/> 
DO random pick three main words <br/> 
IF word is chosen <br/> 
	draw zig zag lines in red <br/> 
ELSE IF other word is chosen <br/> 
	draw diagonal line in green <br/> 
ELSE IF other word chosen <br/> 
	draw triangles in blue <br/> 
ELSE IF length of text is > 20 words <br/> 
	draw large <br/> 
ELSE IF length of text is < 20 words <br/> 
	draw small <br/> 

FUNCTION text to image <br/> 
FOR draw text <br/> 
DO make final image <br/> 
THEN weaving image <br/> 
END IF image is complete <br/> 
OUTPUT weaving tapestry  <br/> 

### Experimentation <br>
To further explore weavings from last week. I've experimented with weaving type animations on processing to determine how I could somehow mimic a weaving gesture. I've found some examples and altered them to the point where it's erratic and entwine like. This could potentially be an outcome of the project  <br>

### Processing - Speech to Text <br>
Speech to text experimentation in todays workshop! Which will be very helpful for my project. <br>

## Project Now <br>
I've tried to explore speech to text library, however I did not know how to import it. But luckily Karen went through it in class.

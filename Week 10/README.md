# Week 10 
## Progress of Project 
__P5 Play__ <br>
I have been playing around with the p5 play libary to create my game. I have experimented with animations. [Allison Parrish's](https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/making-games-with-p5-play/) site really helped me to start the game and to try different techniques. However, the sketch I made was a bit glitchy in terms of the animation not overlapping the coins and restarting the game. _GhostPlay01 is the updated version_ <br>

__Questions to think about__ <br>
- What now? How will you move foward from this? <br>
- What is it about the typography will effect the users perspective/emotions/thinking? <br>
- Are you exploring the limits of typography? 

__Feedback from Andy__ <br>
_"Interesting evolution of your idea. Instead of revealing YOUR secret, why not reveal the secrets of others. Maybe add more game elements... mushrooms? pathways? coins? etc eeetc [unless this is meant to be a minimal approach, in which case, ignore me!]"_ This was a great idea to create a server to input other peoples confessions that are unknown to create games. However, I still need to figure out how to create a successful game within p5js. <br>

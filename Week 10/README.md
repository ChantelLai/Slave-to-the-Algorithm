__Feedback from Andy__ <br>
_"Interesting evolution of your idea. Instead of revealing YOUR secret, why not reveal the secrets of others. Maybe add more game elements... mushrooms? pathways? coins? etc eeetc [unless this is meant to be a minimal approach, in which case, ignore me!]"_ This was a great idea to create a server to input other peoples confessions that are unknown to create games. However, I still need to figure out how to create a successful game within p5js.

### Pseudo code <br/> 
_["Pseudocode is a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or another system. Pseudocode often uses structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode)_ <br/>
This is a simple pseudo code of a task I do daily, eating and drinking. <br/>

Input hunger <br/> 
IF thirsty <br/> 
  make coffee <br/> 
	add grounds <br/> 
	steam milk <br/> 
	add sugar <br/> 
ELSE IF hunrgy <br/> 
	make a sandwich <br/> 
	toast bread <br/> 
	add ham <br/> 
	add cheese <br/> 
END IF not hungry <br/> 
OUTPUT satisfied <br/> 

### Processing <br/> 
Processing session on moving text (not sure why my letters came out japanese?) <br/>

## Research/Project <br/> 
I have slightly changed my project from using a polygraph test to speech to text to image. Using sensors will be slightly difficult and unrealistic for me as I didn't want to purchase any montitors/sensors. I've decided to alter it by using the text/speech of the user to then create patterns/images which will be produced to weavings. Karen mentioned it could be a weaving ' recipe', where users can make their own weavings at home. I thought this was a great idea for those stuck at home with nothing to do. Karen also mentioned about speech to text coding in P5.js which I will have to experiment with. However, my question is if I would still want it the topic to be a 'secret' or to be a just a 'confession/reflection' as it can be a personal reflection for the user with the weaving. At this point, I think I would want it to be a website for users to view and play with. <br/> 

### Weaving <br/> 
I've explored some weaving prototype by making a cardboard loom to determine how I wanted to view the final outcome of my project. I've looked up some youtibe tutorials on how to make weavings/taperstries and followed along. However, I didn't have any coloured yarn, so I had used some thread. Using the thread made it difficult due to the thinness which I had to go over a couple of times. In the end I enjoyed the experience as it was relaxing and might want to pusue further in the project.

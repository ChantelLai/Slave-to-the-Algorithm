__12 Hour Challenge__

For the 12 hour challenge, I decided to do it on my walk to get coffee. From the table I made, the parametres were, the distance, would I listen to music or a podcast, what I would eat along the way, the type of coffee and which hand I would drink it with. This will be determined with a flip of a coin.

In the end I had gotten with the long way to the cafe, listening to music, eating a choc chip cookie with my latte on my left hand. As an indecisive person, I found this challenge enjoyable as it makes decision making easier aha.

#Week 2 Processing

In week 2, Karen had introduced Processing. She taught us the basics codes such as shapes and colours. At first it was very intimidating yet exciting as it was my first experience with coding. However, once getting the hang of things it was fun and exciting as there were so many possibilites that you could make just in Processing alone. 

As an activity, we had to make a self protrait of ourselves. I was dissapointed in the outcome of my self protrait aha. It look very bland and boring. However! a peer from class commented and said it looked like no face from spirited away which was nice. Remixing other peoples work really helped me to get used to Prcessing, such as moving different parts of the face that Karen taught us (mouseX, mouseY).

Karen had also shown some artists that vary in generative design. Some designers that I have researched and enjoy their work are:
Ravon kwok
Mark Dorf 
Tim Rodenbroeker 

I've researched each designers work to get a glimpse and understanding their style of generative design. This will also give me an understanding of what I would want to produce for my pitch and final project

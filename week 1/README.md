# Week 1 Intro

__What is Generative Design__

I have never explored the thought of coding or even the topic of generative design before viewing the studio options. Being exposed to a new world of design can be scary and intimidating, especially when it comes to technology. However, getting my head around of generative design is actually fascinating! The many possibilities that you produce within generative/parametre design is unlimited. From Karen comparing generative design to making breakfast in the morning was a really good example for me to understand what it is. Having parametres and a system of everyday life is already generative design. 


__Group Activity__

To further understand the concept of generative/parametre design, we completed a group activity in class. The activity was to create parametres to produce an art piece determined by dice. Therefore, making an algorithm from parametres. Our group's parametres were shapes, colours, composition and weight of stroke. After viewing everyones work I've learnt about how creative you can be with this activity. This activity gave me an outlook of what direction I want to take creativitly. 

__Inspiration / Artists__ 

From the first class, Karen had shown many artists of generative design that varies in specialty. Raven Kwok caught my eye as his work is animation based. 

__Thoughts__

From the examples that Karen showed, im really interested in interactive and animation design, so I would want to produce maybe something in the realm of this that personally means something for my pitch and major project. However, I still need to research further of artists and designs to get ideas and inspiration. I've always been really curious about coding so im excited to see what the rest of this studio offers!

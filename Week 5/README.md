# Week 5 <br>
## In class <br>
Todays classes was all catered to our project pitch presentations. From viewing everyones presentations, I found it so interesting and inspiring to see different forms of generative art yet similarities between each other. 

## Final Project Pitch <br>
### Visible Secrets <br>

__Context__ <br>
Secrets,something that is kept or meant to be kept unknown or unseen by others. For this project I wanted to contradict that. I want to explore the idea of secrets as it is an interesting topic that divides truth and deception. I also wanted to demonstrate a way to show human attachment to words. <br>

So what is the project, A polygraph test is conducted to an individual telling a secret or confession. Conducting the test will determine the userâ€™s involuntary physiological responses of their statement. From these results it will then produce individual weaving tapestry art pieces. <br>

_**Input = human responses + process = data visualisation + outputs = weaving image**_

__Why?__ <br>
It will show the connection between human and machine to collectively produce art. It will also demonstrate the different viewpoints from one another comparing their levels of secrets by their bodily responses. As said before, I wanted to contradict the view of secrets, therefore being called visble secrets. Secrets are mysterious so in creating this people will feel intrigued to see what people are hiding. Have a weaving outcome to show attachment to secrets and to metaphorically represent the layers of intimacy. <br>

__How?__ <br>
A polygraph test see changes in heart rate, blood pressure and perspiration. It uses transducers to convert the information to digital signals that can be stored on computers and analysed using sophisticated mathematical algorithms. From the data, it can be translated into processing to produce an image. That image is then taken into ned graphics. Ned graphics is a program used for textile designers to create weaving and print patterns. It is used mainly for large complex designs. It creates a colour palette which is then applied to the image which then weaves the design on a loom (Jacquard loom).<br>

__Outcomes__ <br>
Possible outcomes of this can be an exhibition to showcase individual weaving art pieces from the different users of the wavelengths the polygraph produces. Or it can create one large tapestry that combines all of the users data image. Or even the measurements from the polygraph test can be represented by a shape/pattern/object/colours to create a larger and random abstract art piece. Or can all be digitalised with a similar concept. <br>
